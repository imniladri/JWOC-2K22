                <h4>What is JGEC Winter of Code?</h4>
                <div class="sub_block_grp">
                    <p>
                        JWoC (JGEC Winter of Code) is an Open Source event organised annually by JGEC
                        which helps students to plunge into Open Source contribution and get the realm
                        of Software Development.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The main idea is to get students involved in and familiar with the open source community.
                        There will be various projects available in Github, and you have to contribute
                        in any of the projects. Each project will be assigned to a mentor who will be there
                        to guide you in any stage.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The program is designed in such a similar way to GSoC (One of the Most Prestigious
                        Open Source Program) to give you a taste of it, and to drive away the fear of
                        participating in it.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="block_grp">
                <h4>Goals of the Program</h4>
                <ul class="blue">
                    <li>
                        Encourage young developers to participate in Open Source Development.

                    <li>
                        Help them to get more familiarized with the Open Source World and using Git & Github.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Give students more exposure to Software Development.

                    <li>
                        Guide them how to work in a team and inspire them to take part in more

                        The Community Bonding period is given for all to interact with the mentors to
                        understand the projects and issues. Mentees are not allowed to opt for any issues
                        during this period. Any necessary help regarding the tech stack or tutorials are
                        to be provided by the respective Project Mentors.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Issues will be allotted on a First-Come-First-Serve basis and are applicable only
                        when they are opted through GitHub. You can start working on an issue only after
                        it has been assigned to you by the Mentor.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Mentees are allowed to work only for a maximum of 2 issues at a time across all
                        projects. No more issues will be allotted before they are completed, i.e the
                        Pull Request for the respective issue is successfully merged.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Each issue needs to be completed within a specific time limit according to its
                        difficulty level (<span>Easy: 1 day</span>, <span>Medium: 2-3 days</span> and
                        <span>Hard: 4 days</span>). If a mentee is unable to solve the allotted issue
                        within the given period, the issue will be passed to other contenders on the
                        discretion of the Mentor.

                        We encourage you to ask your doubts and seek community help in the respective

                        At first, make it clear that it is less about competing and more about learning.
                        So if you are ready to learn about software development and open source you must
                        participate. And even if you are already a developer then you will also be able
                        to grow your skills with direct contribution.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The experience of solving an issue and the joy of getting your pr merged will be
                        amazing and unique as well.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Building your network is one of the most important parts of learning, during this
                        period you will interact and share ideas with your mentor and team mates which
                        you help you to grow in your career.

                    <p>
                        If you love coding and feel passionate about making some cool projects then
                        it will be the right choice for you.
